# About me

Welcome! I am a PhD student in Statistics with [Paul BÃ¼rkner](https://paulbuerkner.com/)
at [TU Dortmund](https://compstat.statistik.tu-dortmund.de/en/). My main research
project centers on the development of [Bayesian latent variable models](https://paulbuerkner.com/projects/#bdlvms)
for applications in psychology and cognitive science. Along the way, I've become
deeply interested in three key components of the [Bayesian workflow](https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.01808):
model diagnostics, prior specification, and probabilistic programming languages.

You can find my publications on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=9tEblG4AAAAJ).
